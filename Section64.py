# /*
#  * A segment is made up of zero or more sections.  Non-MH_OBJECT files have
#  * all of their segments with the proper sections in each, and padded to the
#  * specified segment alignment when produced by the link editor.  The first
#  * segment of a MH_EXECUTE and MH_FVMLIB format file contains the mach_header
#  * and load commands of the object file before its first section.  The zero
#  * fill sections are always last in their segment (in all formats).  This
#  * allows the zeroed segment padding to be mapped into memory where zero fill
#  * sections might be. The gigabyte zero fill sections, those with the section
#  * type S_GB_ZEROFILL, can only be in a segment with sections of this type.
#  * These segments are then placed after all other segments.
#  *
#  * The MH_OBJECT format has all of its sections in one segment for
#  * compactness.  There is no padding to a specified segment boundary and the
#  * mach_header and load commands are not part of the segment.
#  *
#  * Sections with the same section name, sectname, going into the same segment,
#  * segname, are combined by the link editor.  The resulting section is aligned
#  * to the maximum alignment of the combined sections and is the new section's
#  * alignment.  The combined sections are aligned to their original alignment in
#  * the combined section.  Any padded bytes to get the specified alignment are
#  * zeroed.
#  *
#  * The format of the relocation entries referenced by the reloff and nreloc
#  * fields of the section structure for mach object files is described in the
#  * header file <reloc.h>.
